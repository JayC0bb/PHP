# PHP Data Type Testing Code
This code is designed to test various data types in PHP 5.6.18. The code generates functions for testing five data types: int, float, string, array, and object. Each generated function takes a single argument, which represents the input value, and returns the input value unchanged.

The code uses a foreach loop to iterate over an array of data types, generates a function for each data type, and then evaluates the generated code with the eval function. The program uses the switch statement to determine the value of the input variable based on the data type. Finally, the code uses another foreach loop to call each generated function and dump its output.

# Getting Started
To use this code, simply copy and paste the code into a PHP file, then run the file on a server or local environment with PHP 5.6.18 installed. The output of the code will show the result of the data type testing.

# Modifying the Code
If you want to test additional data types, simply add them to the $data_types array. You may also modify the code to test different input values or change the output format as needed.

# Conclusion
This code is a simple and effective way to test various data types in PHP 5.6.18. By using this code, you can quickly and easily verify that your code is working as expected, and ensure that the correct data type is being passed to and returned from your functions.
